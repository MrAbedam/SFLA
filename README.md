# SystemC Implementation of the Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (SFLA)
(Implementation of the following paper:[2202.03477v1.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23145261/2202.03477v1.pdf))
 
## üìò Overview
This project provides a **SystemC-based implementation** of the **Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (SFLA)** ‚Äî a population-based metaheuristic inspired by memetic evolution and social learning among individuals.  
Originally proposed by Eusuff and Lansey (2006), SFLA combines the strengths of **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** and **memetic algorithms**, making it suitable for solving complex combinatorial and continuous optimization problems.

This implementation models SFLA‚Äôs distributed and parallel nature through **SystemC** modules and processes, enabling simulation of population evolution at a hardware-description level.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Description
The SFLA consists of a population of solutions (‚Äúfrogs‚Äù) divided into subgroups known as **memeplexes**. Each memeplex performs a local search to improve its frogs, while periodic shuffling enables global information sharing.

### Algorithm Phases
1. **Initialization** ‚Äì Randomly generate the population of frogs (solutions).  
2. **Memeplex Division** ‚Äì Partition frogs into memeplexes based on fitness.  
3. **Local Search** ‚Äì Improve the worst frog‚Äôs position using best frog influence.  
4. **Global Shuffle** ‚Äì Exchange information between memeplexes.  
5. **Termination** ‚Äì Stop when convergence or iteration limits are met.

---

## üß© SystemC Architecture
The algorithm is implemented using **SystemC processes and channels**, representing each frog and memeplex as concurrent modules:

- `Frog` module ‚Äì stores position and fitness  
- `Memeplex` module ‚Äì handles local search and memetic evolution  
- `Controller` module ‚Äì manages synchronization and global shuffling  
- `Monitor` module ‚Äì tracks global best solution and convergence

The architecture supports modular scalability and concurrent evaluation of frogs, reflecting real-world parallel optimization.

---

## üß† Features
- Fully modular **SystemC simulation of SFLA**
- Hardware-level modeling of population-based optimization
- Adjustable hyperparameters (population size, memeplex count, step size)
- Supports real-time convergence visualization and logging

---

## üßÆ Example Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| `m` | Number of memeplexes |
| `n` | Frogs per memeplex |
| `Smax` | Maximum leaping step |
| `N` | Number of local iterations |
| `Fitness()` | User-defined objective function |
